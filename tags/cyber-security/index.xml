In a world where there exists an ever-growing economy revolving around the sale and processing of individuals’ private data, tools like GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) offer a convenient way to take back control of what was once a well-respected right – individual privacy. I have spoken before on several occasions about why it is important to take your privacy seriously, and to be clear, GPG is not by any means an extensive solution; it is to a smaller extent a part of a much larger mosaic of tools needed to completely take control of your privacy.</description></item><item><title>How to improve your internet privacy (for free!)</title><link>https://gwood.dev/blog/2021/08/how-to-improve-your-internet-privacy-for-free/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Aug 2021 21:01:56 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://gwood.dev/blog/2021/08/how-to-improve-your-internet-privacy-for-free/</guid><description>Note: I am not in any way affiliated with Cloudflare, I just think they&amp;rsquo;re cool!
Introduction As I&amp;rsquo;ve made clear in previous publications, I believe passionately that everyone should take their own digital hygiene and privacy seriously. In a world where users&amp;rsquo; personal data is the backbone of a $1.7 trillion industry [1], it is vitally important that the average person takes a stand.
Cloudflare is a company which (unless you&amp;rsquo;re a computer scientist) I&amp;rsquo;d forgive you for not recognising in the slightest; however, what they do is paramount to the smooth running of the internet.</description></item><item><title>BCrypt Login System - Proof of Concept</title><link>https://gwood.dev/blog/2021/01/bcrypt-login-system/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Jan 2021 15:26:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gwood.dev/blog/2021/01/bcrypt-login-system/</guid><description>Following on from some of my previous content about data security, I&amp;rsquo;ve written a short proof of concept program showing how BCrypt can be used to securely store passwords.

This guide will focus on the GNU Privacy Guard (GPG), and will cover two main aspects: signing, and encryption.
Signing &amp;amp; Encryption: What are they? Signing Data signing is the the process of mathematically guaranteeing that a given file came from a given individual.</description></item></channel></rss>
