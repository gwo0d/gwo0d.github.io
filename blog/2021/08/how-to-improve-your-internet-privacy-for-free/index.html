hygiene and privacy seriously. In a world where users&rsquo; personal data is the backbone of a $1.7 trillion industry
<a href=#references>[1]</a>, it is vitally important that the average person takes a stand.</p><p><a href=https://www.cloudflare.com>Cloudflare</a> is a company which (unless you&rsquo;re a computer scientist) I&rsquo;d forgive you for
not recognising in the slightest; however, what they do is paramount to the smooth running of the internet.
A staggering 10% of all internet requests run through Cloudflare&rsquo;s network<a href=#references>[2]</a> (including
the request you made to visit this website) making it one of the main players in the internet&rsquo;s day-to-day working.
Cloudflare, in my opinion, is one of a dwindling number of honourable big tech companies who not only genuinely
respect their users&rsquo; privacy, but actively work to protect it.</p><hr><hr><h2 id=what-can-cloudflare-do-for-me>What can Cloudflare do for me?</h2><p>Cloudflare makes most of its money offering cyber security solutions and protections to large internet companies;
because of this, they have a lot of headroom to offer easy to use, comprehensive, and secure privacy protecting
tools to individuals and small businesses for free.</p><p>To a computer scientist (like me), this is good because we have access to a myriad of really cool tools we can
use for our internet-based antics - for example, I send all the traffic for both this website and my <a href=https://gwood.dev>personal website</a>
through the Cloudflare network. I choose to do this because for me, it offers some really fancy security tools to
make sure my website uses top-notch security standards, and for you, the loading speeds when you visit this site are
17% faster<a href=#references>[3]</a>.</p><p>To the average user, however, Cloudflare still has something to offer you. Their DNS service <a href=https://1.1.1.1>1.1.1.1 with Warp</a>
offers vastly improved speed alongside vastly improved privacy, and it&rsquo;s as simple as downloading an app and
flipping a switch. It routes all the web requests from your device through Cloudflare&rsquo;s high speed network, and it
does so through a proprietary protocol called Warp (based on <a href=https://www.wireguard.com>WireGuard</a>) which improves
your security by encrypting your traffic all whilst preserving most of your speed. They also offer a paid service
called Warp+ (Â£4.99/month) which seamlessly adds something called <a href=https://blog.cloudflare.com/argo/>Argo Smart Routing</a> to your connection, essentially putting you into the
internet fast lane for up to 30% increased speeds<a href=#references>[4]</a>. Although this is an entirely optional
addition, I would recommend giving it a try if your internet speed is important to you.</p><p>Seriously&mldr; Cloudflare are awesome, I use them, and you should too!</p><h2 id=what-cant-cloudflare-do-for-me>What can&rsquo;t Cloudflare do for me?</h2><p>As much as using <a href=https://1.1.1.1>1.1.1.1 with Warp</a> is a huge step in the right direction, and will effectively
hide which websites you visit from your ISP, it isn&rsquo;t a comprehensive solution. To the average person, it really is
most of what you need, but in any scenario where your internet privacy, security, and anonymity are essential,
you&rsquo;ll need to use a paid VPN service. Personally I use <a href=https://nordvpn.com/>NordVPN</a> <em>(not affiliated)</em>, as from my
research and experience, they offer the best service at a fair price, but any VPN with OpenVPN/WireGuard support, a
strict &rsquo;no logs&rsquo; policy, and reputable third-party auditing should do the trick - always do your research!</p><h2 id=summary>Summary</h2><p>To summarise, every company with a stake in advertising are after your personal data in some way or another; if
you&rsquo;re fine with that, I think you&rsquo;re wrong but that&rsquo;s fair enough. If, however, you&rsquo;re like me and you&rsquo;re very
concerned about your privacy being compromised, I highly recommend following the instructions on the <a href=https://1.1.1.1>1.1.1.1</a>
website and using it on your device(s); it won&rsquo;t hide everything from everyone, but it&rsquo;s a bloomin&rsquo; good start! If
your privacy/security is essential, or if you&rsquo;re just paranoid, get yourself a decent paid VPN.</p><h2 id=references>References</h2><ol><li>Forbes. 2019.
